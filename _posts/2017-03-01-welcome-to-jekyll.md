You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.
$$\sqrt{2x+1}$$ and another equation $$x$$ and $$x+b = c$$
and


New Equations: $a=b$ and $b=c$ so $\rightarrow a=c$

$$y=mx+b$$

something more complicated:

$$\underset{n-1 \text{ ones per row}}{
\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & \cdots & 1 \\
1 & 0 & \cdots & 1 \\
\vdots & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots \\
1 & 1 & \cdots & 0
\end{pmatrix} }\scriptsize{n \text{ columns}}
$$

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
