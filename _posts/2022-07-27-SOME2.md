We will be investigating the value of **network effects**, a term referring to phenomena where "the more people use a product, the more valuable the product becomes". Now, this may seem intuitively true, but why should it? After all, while receiving some Lego set when I was 10, I am certain that I would not have enjoyed the product more knowing a child in Switzerland was too. Well, I was not influenced by my Swiss friend because the value of a network largely depends on the _type_ of product. Industries like social media (or online article publishers) are valuable largely because they establish spaces where I can connect with other users (friends to communicate with, potential readers, etc.).

So for particular products we see that their value increases as the number of users increase. But as scientists, it is not only desirable to know a relationship is _generally_ positive, but also determine _how_ that relationship changes. In other words, "how do we mathematically quantify a product's value to its number of users?"


This article will provide an introductory treatment about how networks are valued through a couple of proposed mathematical formula, while emphasizing their assumptions, derivation, and applicability. For us, this will only require some basic combinatorics (counting)! We will then look at a more realistic model utilizing a matrix formulation which conveniently generalizes our observations about networks.

### Sarnoff's Law
Let's think of the simplest possible network with $n$ users: a network without any connections! This may seem a little silly, but it is often useful to think of these limit cases when creating models.

<center>A simple network with four nodes and no connections</center>

In a network with $n$ people and no connections, the only value we have comes from the people themselves. Where may this be applicable? Well, if we are tasked with selling something simple like lemonade (and our parents paid for the supplies), we would earn a fixed amount of money for every person served. So here, we could think of this customer base as a non-interacting network. It follows that since every customer returns a fixed value, the total value will just be proportional to the total number of customers/users:

$$ V_{1}(n) = k_1n$$

This is called **Sarnoff's Law**. Though it may seem simple, this was actually proposed when looking at the value of TV networks, which are delivered to customers who do not "interact" while using the service. This could also apply to streaming services like Netflix, web portals, etc.

### Metcalf's Law
Now let us think about the other limit case: our network has as many connections as possible! (Here, we assume that there is at most one connection between two users). Since we have both users and connections, how would we determine the value of our network? Well, let us think about a network which is built on many connections, like a community of buyers and sellers. For someone looking to join this selling network, they aren't really as concerned about the amount of buyers and sellers but rather how many transactions occur between them. This is because we gain money in these transactions. Similarly, for a highly connected network, it seems reasonable to assume that the value is characterized by the _connections_ and not the _users_.

So, that means to find our second value function $V_2$ we need to find the number of connections in this maximally integrated network. Well, by our definition of connections between users, every user is connected to every other user; we need to count how many "lines" we have resulting from these connections.

Let's go over a small case first. How many two-member teams (connections) do we have in the four-person group Alice, Bob, Cheryl, and Don? Well, we only need two people to form a connection. There are $4$ choices for the first teammate and $3$ choices to for the second teammate, giving a total of $12$ pairings. However, we actually double-counted! For example, we have including teams where Alice was first chosen, Bob was second chosen and vice-versa. So our final answer is $\frac{12}{2} = 6$ total teams. Similar reasoning implies that the number of two-people connections for a group of $n$ people is given by

 $$ \text{connections}={n\choose2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$$

A sanity check: plugging $n=4$ into this equation yields $6$, exactly what we calculated for our small example. Since we assumed that the value of our network is primarily driven by our connection number, we finally have

$$ V_{2}(n)=k_2\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\approx k_2n^2 $$

The "$\approx$" essentially becomes equality when $n^2 \gg n$, which happens for large $n$. This quadratic expression is called **Metcalf's Law**, and is also (from my understanding) the most common relationship for describing network value. This formula would seem most appropriate when considering a network with many pairwise connections which give value to the user. This could include selling platforms like OfferUp or dating apps like Tinder.

### Matrices and the Network Effect

We will now attempt a different approach to completing this model walking through an article published by Emmrich and Kaldasch[^1]. For the model setup, we consider a system like the one addressed with Metcalf’s Law:

- $n$ nodes
- connection values $a_{ij}$ from node $i$ to node $j$ for all nodes

The reason directional connection values $a_{ij}$ are introduced is to allow the possibility for “uneven” relationships. For example, if a large content creator (1) shouts out a smaller one (2), the value received to the smaller creator, in this case, would be greater than that received by the larger one. In our formalism, we would have $a_{12}>a_{21}$; the value generated from the network is greater for the smaller creator.

Seeing this inspiration, we can create a matrix of these connection values:

$$A = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\
\vdots & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_{n1} & a_{n2} & \cdots & a_{nn}
\end{pmatrix}$$

But wait, what about the diagonal elements of the matrix $A$? i.e., how do we interpret terms like $a_{11}$ where we have a connection from person (1) to themself? While it doesn’t make much sense to have a self connection, we could interpret these elements as the values associated with a node/person being a part of the network (independent of connections). Note that this is exactly what we were considering with Sarnoff’s Law, where we simply counted the number of users (or customers)! Let us separate these diagonal elements into another matrix for bookkeeping purposes. We then have:

$$A = \underbrace{\begin{pmatrix} 0 & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n}\\
a_{21} & 0 & \cdots & a_{2n} \\
\vdots & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_{n1} & a_{n2} & \cdots & 0
\end{pmatrix}} _ {\text{connection values}} + 
\underbrace{\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
0 & a_{22} & \cdots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \cdots & a_{nn}
\end{pmatrix}} _ {\text{individual values}}$$

The first matrix gives the value for connections and the second matrix gives the value for the individuals.

We can now think about the total utility, or value $V$, of this network. Since each element $a_{ij}$ constitutes one part of the value of the network, the total value will just be the sum of the elements in our matrix! In summation notation, we have

$$V=\sum_{i,j}{a_{ij}} = \sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^{n}{a_{ij}}$$

since there are $n$ users in our network. But we can also break up this sum up to evaluate the elements of the connection and individual matrices separately:

$$V=\sum_{i,j}{a_{ij}} = \sum_{i\neq j}{a_{i j}} + \sum_{i = j}{a_{i j}}$$

Since either $i=j$ or $i\neq j$, we know that we have exhausted all the possible elements of our matrix and the equality holds.

Now the fun part! Suppose that we have the following rule determining the elements of $A$:

$$
a_{ij} = 
\begin{cases}
k_1 & i=j \\
\frac{1}{2}k_2 & i \neq j
\end{cases}
$$

This rule means that the value for any individual in the network $(i=j)$ is the same, and that the connection value between any two people is equally shared (the “total” connection value is worth $k_2$, but we evenly credit this to both people). Substituting this rule creates our new value matrix

$$\Rightarrow A =
\frac{1}{2}k_1 \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & \cdots & 1\\
1 & 0 & \cdots & 1 \\
\vdots & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots \\
1 & 1 & \cdots & 0
\end{pmatrix} +
k_2 \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
0 & 1 & \cdots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \cdots & 1
\end{pmatrix}$$

where we have factored out the proportionality factors $k_1$ and $k_2$. To find the total value of our network, we can apply the formula for $V$ by summing the elements of both matrices. The second matrix only has entries on the diagonal, so ignoring our $k_2$ factor, the sum is just $n$. The connection matrix is a little more complicated:

$$\underset{n-1 \text{ ones per row}}{
\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & \cdots & 1 \\
1 & 0 & \cdots & 1 \\
\vdots & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots \\
1 & 1 & \cdots & 0
\end{pmatrix} }\scriptsize{n \text{ columns}}
$$

We can see that since we have $n-1$ ones times $n$ columns to give the total number of elements in this matrix, which is just $n(n-1)$. Taking all of this information together, we finally get

$$V(n) = k_1\frac{n(n-1)}{2}+k_2n$$

Which is the **sum** of both Sarnoff and Metcalf’s Law! Note that if we had no connections in our network, making $a_{ij}=0$ for $i\neq j$, we would exactly recover Sarnoff’s Law, and if we ignored the value of each individual, setting $a_{ij}=0$ for $i=j$, we would exactly recover Metcalf’s Law.

From this exercise, it is easy to see that we have much more flexibility in this formalism, so that by populating the matrix $A$ with realistic connection values, we can more accurately portray the value of our network. For instance, Emmrich and Kaldasch consider what happens if you don’t have the same connection value with all $n$ people, and the resulting value of your network is a generalized version of Metcalf’s Law[^1].

## Conclusion

### Summary
We have introduced the definition of networks and motivated their importance in quantifying the value of certain businesses. Then, two models describing the growth of network value were explored, culminating with a unifying framework involving matrices! Hopefully this serves as a clean case-study for the utility of mathematics in a tangible application as well as a reminder that the conclusions made from one’s analysis are intimately tied to starting assumptions. That is why generalizations like the one presented here are so powerful, uniting two perspectives about how value scales with the number of users.

### Final thoughts and next steps
Though the arguments presented here are clean, they certainly rely on some strong assumptions (as already mentioned). Real networks do not provide the same return on a user as the number of users increase and even some of the network values are domain dependent (Uber may not be as valuable as you think)[^2]. There are also at least two other popular notions involving the value of a network ($2^n, n\log n$) which have reasonable assumptions[^3][^4]. There even exists an entire textbook dedicated to thinking about the influence of networks[^5]. For further inquiry, I recommend beginning with the references below, as this question of network effects has surprisingly sophisticated work and intriguing applications found in the economic, computer, and mathematical sciences.
