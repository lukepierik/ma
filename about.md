My name is Luke Pierik; nice to meet you! My background is in applied mathematics and physics, but I have recently started research in mathematical biology.
This website is currently dedicated to 3blue1brownâ€™s Summer of Math Exposition 2 (SOME2), with a submission on network effects.

Thanks for the push, Grant :)
